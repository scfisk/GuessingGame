# Overview

This is a simple number guessing game created using java. It generates a random number between 1 and 100 and the user has 8 chances to guess the correct number. After each guess, it tells the user if the guess was too high or too low. 

I used this program as an opportunity to get more comfortable with basic Java syntax and structure. It was simple enough that I didn't get hung up on the complexity, but had enough meat for me to practice some aspect of Java that were new to me.

# Development Environment

I used InteliJ by JetBrains. I enjoy the JetBrains IDEs because they are intuitive and easy to use. 

I used Java for this project so I could get more familiar with it, as it's a language I have used very little.

# Future Work

- Make the hint an option that the user can select
- Allow the user to choose the number range
- Add additional error handling
- Include classes so I can get used to inheritance in Java
- Improve encapsulation of functions
